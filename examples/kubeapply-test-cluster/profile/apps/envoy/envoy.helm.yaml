# releaseName: kubeapply-envoy

# The comment above is a special directive that kubeapply uses for setting the release name
# in the call to `helm template...`.

# The parameters below are helm value overrides for the chart.
#
# Note that it's possible to make this file itself a template that's expanded before the call
# to helm by changing the name to `envoy.helm.gotpl.yaml`.
